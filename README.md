# Delphi UCL
Universal Component Library for Delphi VCL

This is an alternative library for https://github.com/VuioVuio/UniversalCL, with better design and easier maintenance.
The old UniversalCL library will be removed soon. Thanks.

## What is news?

1. Better design structure, and easier to maintain.
2. Git history now is more clearly.
3. UpdateTheme now will be called by control's parent, not ThemeManager.
4. Reduce spaghetti code, and more.

## How to install?

1. Clone (or download) this repository to local, and open DelphiUCL.groupproj.
2. Right-click in DelphiUCLPackage.bpl, select Install.
3. Add Source folder path to Delphi library.
4. Enjoy it.
